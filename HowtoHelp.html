The donations of supplies and money allow the program to give 15 minority students each summer the wonderful opportunity of exposure to the various fields of STEM. They are given free meals, get free transportation, and are given free supplies to work with. VAMOS is a prime example on how donations can make a huge difference.<b> With your donations, programs like VAMOS can keep introducing minorities to the wonders of STEM.</b> </p>

If you believe you don't have the time of day to start your program, that is perfectly fine. <b>Another form of initiative would be spreading the word to others. </b>Effecient ways of spreading the word are the following: publish a website regarding the cause, post the cause on your social media, create fliers to hang up or give, tell your friends and family through word of mouth. <b>Any form of initiative that can make people aware of the issue and have them get involved will create a huge positive difference for minority students in our society.</b> </p>

            <p class="mb-0"> If you want to start your own program, know that you cannot do everything on your own. <b>It is important to work with people who can help you organize sessions, fundraisers, or just lend you any supplies or space in order for your program to run effeciently. </b>It is important to have connections. Have friends who can teach sessions for you and organize a schedule for them. <b>Network with people who are happy to offer any form of assistance. </b>Tell them your plans of beginning a STEM program. Stay in contact with them and remember to show appreciation. An example of a person who decided to start a program through the power of connections and networking is Caitlin Lam. She is an undergraduate student who started an academic program for her elementary school when she was a junior in high school. Through the connections she made with classmates in her high school and networking with her district by presenting the idea, she mwas able to run an effecient STEM and Arts program with 40 volunteers. Caitlin is a prime example of how anyone can contribute to the cause of exposing minority students to STEM.</p>
